# ReactJS Training

This training intends to introduce web development using the ReactJS ecosystem to any developer. It consists of different exercises that focus on specific topics that will be learned while coding. You can find the slides that introduce the training [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iB-UDYZbJEOfXmJJ3kj-EklgE_rDcAo-eVZO7fFVcN8/edit#slide=id.g3ec7f0c99c_0_9).

### Key takeaways:

By reading this training, you will learn:

- The basics of web development today (2019/2020)
- How to use React and TypeScript to create web applications
- How to store & manage the state of your web application with React and Redux
- How to build optimized, production-ready applications with zero-configuration.

### Pre-requisites

Before going any further, please install in your laptop:

- [Node 10 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Redux devtools installed in a browser of your choice](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#installation).

## Exercises

We divided the workshop into four Exercises:

- [Understanding React and TypeScript](./exercise-1)
- [Creating your first app with React and TypeScript](./exercise-2)
- [Managing your application state with Redux](./exercise-3)
- [Adding navigation to your app](./exercise-4)
- [Advanced topics](./exercise-5)

Each exercise comes with code that we prepared for you. You will find everything you need to start with inside the **begin** folder, and the result we expect you to achieve inside the **end** folder. You don't need to complete any previous exercises to start a new one: you can either use what you built before or the contents of the **begin** folder you'll find in each Exercise.
